Coded along with guidance from Edureka with modifications for easier readability and unit testing capability. 
The sonar mine-rock dataset is [publically accessible]("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/sonar/") from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Using a basic multilayer perceptron network with 4 hidden layers and some small adjustments to hyperparameters, the model achieved an accuracy of 85%. This number could surely be raised after hyperparameter tuning, but stands as a decent benchmark for a simple model.
